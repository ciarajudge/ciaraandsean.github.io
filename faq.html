							<h2>Will I be able to get photos from the ceremony?</h2>
							<p><b>It is really important to us that our ceremony is 'unplugged', i.e. no smartphone or tablet use, even to take 
                                photos or videos.</b> We want to see your beautiful faces - not have phone screens in the way!
                                We have hired a professional photographer who will capture all the special moments for us, 
                                and we will share these photos with all our guests very soon after the wedding.<b> This request only applies to the ceremony itself;
                                after we have walked back down the aisle as a married couple, feel free to take as many photos as you like for the rest of the day
                                and post to social media to your heart's content!</b>
                            </p>
							<hr class="section-divider">
                            <h2>Do I have to RSVP? Sure you know I'm coming!</h2>
							<p>No we do not know you're coming! Even if it seems super obvious to you that you'll be there, we are coordinating more than 150 guests 
								and we will not assume you're coming if you have not RSVP'd. This is essential so that we can pass on dietary requirements, allergies and 
								necessary mobility accommodations to the hotel. The RSVP list is also required for the hotel to know how many meals to cook! No RSVP = no meal. 
								Trust us - we made our own parents and siblings RSVP.
                            </p>
							<a href="rsvp.html" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Click here to RSVP</a>
                             <hr class="section-divider">
                            <h2>How do I RSVP?</h2>
							<p>You can RSVP using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1IjCSynUaYiS9FmJg0yE0spxEwah3wGqnSgpu-_6kPo8www/viewform?usp=header">this google form</a> (please do so ASAP and before May 1st, 2026). <b>Fill out one form per invited guest.</b> You will be emailed a copy of 
                                your RSVP responses, so if you're not sure whether you've RSVPed, check your email inbox and spam folder. If you have any issues with the form, 
                                please reach out to Ciara or Seán directly.
                            </p>

                            <hr class="section-divider">
                            <h2>Is there a dress code?</h2>
							<p>First and foremost, we'd like you to wear whatever you're comfortable in!
                                But if you want more guidance, typical Irish summer wedding attire is ideal 
                                (cocktail attire). There are no forbidden colours (except white, we suppose!) -
                                just wear what makes you happy.</p>
                            <hr class="section-divider">
							<h2>Can I bring a plus one?</h2>
							<p>Sadly, due to limitations on space, we can only accommodate plus ones who are named on the invite.</p>
                            <hr class="section-divider">
                            <h2>What time is the ceremony?</h2>
							<p>The ceremony is at 2pm. For those staying onsite, check-in is at 3pm, but you can drop your bags to reception 
                                prior to the ceremony and if you ask nicely, the staff may move them to your room for you when it's ready!
                            </p>
							<p>
								If your name is Kirsty Andresen, the ceremony begins at 1:30pm. If your name is Aiden Mullally, the ceremony begins at 1pm and you don't need a packed lunch.
							</p>
							<hr class="section-divider">
							<h2>Is the ceremony indoors or outdoors?</h2>
							<p>Due to the unpredictable nature of Irish weather, we are not able to say for certain - Fernhill has beautiful options for 
								both indoor and outdoor ceremonies and we will be making this decision closer to the day. All we can say is we recommend
								wearing sunscreen if (fingers crossed) it is a very sunny day. If it is raining, or if the sun is too hot, the ceremony will be
								indoors and there will be air conditioning.
							</p>
                            <hr class="section-divider">
							<h2>Can I stay at Fernhill?</h2>
							<p>There is some accommodation onsite at Fernhill for the evening of the wedding, August 8th. If we have space 
                                to allocate a room to you, we will contact you with a booking code if we haven't already. If you're unsure, 
                                please also feel free to reach out to us. If you are not staying in Fernhill, there are many alternative accommodation 
                                options nearby - please see our <a href="travel-accom.html#fh5co-header-section">Travel & Accommodation page</a> for more details. There will be taxi shuttles ready at Fernhill 
                                to take guests back to any nearby accommodation at the end of the night.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What's on the menu?</h2>
                            <p>The menu will be decided closer to the time, but rest assured, any dietary requirements or allergies shared on the RSVP form 
                                will be catered for carefully. You do not need to select your meal in advance - you'll be able to order on the day.
                            </p>
                            <hr class="section-divider">
							<h2>What about gifts?</h2>
                            <p>We didn't want to say this for fear of sounding presumptuous, but we've had this question a few times! Traditionally at Irish weddings, guests give cash 
								and not physical gifts. We are still ironing out these logistics but there's usually a 'wedding post' box at the hotel. If in doubt, please seek out Seán's best man Conor.
                            </p>
                            <hr class="section-divider">
							<h2>Are kids invited?</h2>
							<p>Of course! Any invited little ones will have been named on the invite, or are covered by 'and family'.</p>
                             <hr class="section-divider">
							<h2>I have a question that isn't answered here. Who do I contact?</h2>
							<p>Ciara or Seán! We would very much hope that, seeing as you're invited, you have contact information for at least one of us.</p>
